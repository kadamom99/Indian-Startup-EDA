# Indian-Startup-EDA
India is a global hub and there are many startups that are emerging as unicorn and competing against the world in various platforms and domains.
India registers almost 10000+ private limited every month apart from Sole proprietorship or LLP or Foreign companies with Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

Analysing on these data on Location of registration and types of business gives you the trend where the industry is heading towards.
This is always a curious point for me to see where the future is!!!

The Dataset contains the list of companies registered with MCA across India in 2021.

The data is anonymised and unique id is generated for the companies registered
